An example of using [react-jsonld-editor](https://github.com/editorsnotes/react-jsonld-editor) with dynamically loaded vocabuaries from [Linked Open Vocabularies](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/):

1. First, add some vocabularies.
1. Then, use the classes and properties from those vocabularies to create a valid JSON-LD object. 
1. When you're done, save it to a file.
